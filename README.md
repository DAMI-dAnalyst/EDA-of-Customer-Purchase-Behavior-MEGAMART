# Customer Purchase Behaviour(MEGAMART)
## Overview
This project is part of the "Predicting Customer Response for MegaMart" initiative. The goal is to explore and analyze customer behavior, spending patterns, and responses to marketing campaigns through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). This detailed README outlines the steps taken in the EDA process to uncover insights that will inform strategic decisions for customer segmentation, targeted marketing, and customer retention.

## Project Objective
MegaMart aims to boost customer loyalty and increase sales by predicting the likelihood of customer responses to a new Gold Membership Offer. As part of this process, we performed an Exploratory Data Analysis to:
- Understand customer demographics and behavior
- Analyze total spending and purchase patterns
- Identify the most effective marketing channels
- Discover correlations between customer purchase behavior and response to campaigns
- Segment customers for optimized marketing efforts

## Dataset
The dataset contains various customer attributes collected over the past two years, including:
- Demographics: Customer age, education, marital status, number of children, and household income
- Spending Data: Amount spent on different product categories (wines, meat, fish, fruits, sweets, gold)
- Purchase Channels: Number of purchases made via the web, catalog, and in-store
- Customer Interaction: Website visits, recency of purchases, and customer complaints

## Key Questions Addressed in EDA
How does total spending vary across different customer segments or demographics?
- We explore how customer attributes such as income, education, and household composition impact total spending. This helps identify high-spending customer segments for potential marketing focus.

Which channels (web, catalog, store) contribute the most to the total number of purchases?
- A breakdown of purchases made through different channels reveals which platforms are most successful and where to allocate future marketing efforts.

Do certain product categories have higher or lower average purchase values?
- By examining the average purchase value across product categories (e.g., wines, meat, gold), we can identify which products are driving the most revenue and adjust promotional strategies accordingly.

How does average purchase value correlate with customer response to the campaign?
- We investigate whether customers with higher average purchase values are more likely to respond to marketing campaigns. This insight can help tailor offers to high-value customers.

Are there specific days of the week, months, weekends, seasons, or holiday indicators when purchase frequency increases or decreases?
- Analyzing time-based patterns in purchase frequency allows us to align marketing campaigns with periods of higher customer activity.

Does purchase frequency vary based on customer demographics?
- This analysis reveals whether certain demographic groups (e.g., based on age, income, or household composition) tend to shop more frequently, helping refine customer targeting.

How can we segment customers based on their Customer Value (CV) scores to tailor marketing campaigns or loyalty programs?
- By calculating Customer Value (CV), we segment customers into high and low-value groups, providing actionable insights for personalized marketing efforts.

What characteristics differentiate high-value customers from low-value ones across the features in the dataset?
- This analysis compares the attributes of high and low-value customers, identifying key factors that distinguish them and suggesting ways to increase the value of lower-tier customers.

Are there early indicators in a customer's journey that predict their potential CV and likelihood of becoming a loyal repeat purchaser?
- By examining initial customer interactions, we identify early behaviors or purchases that predict future loyalty and high customer value.

Are there product bundles that resonate particularly well with high-CV customers?
- This analysis focuses on product combinations that are frequently purchased by high-value customers, guiding the creation of attractive bundle offers for this segment.
